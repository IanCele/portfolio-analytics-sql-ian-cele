This setup will position you as a **highly analytical, strategic thinker** with institutional-level expertise, ready to attract **employers and investors**.

If you want, I can **also create the first visual charts (Sharpe, drawdown, correlation matrix) in GitHub-ready PNG format** so your repo is immediately polished and eye-catching. This can massively boost engagement.  

Do you want me to do that next?
